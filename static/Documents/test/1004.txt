Abstractive text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent version of a longer text while preserving its meaning.
Unlike extractive summarization, which selects and copies the most important sentences from the original text,
abstractive summarization aims to create entirely new sentences that convey the most critical information.
This technique requires advanced natural language processing capabilities, as it needs to capture the essence of the original content
and express it in a different way.
Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with models like BART, T5, and Pegasus, have significantly improved the quality of
abstractive summarization. These models are pre-trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific summarization tasks.
